Formally conclude the Funding Round with a blog post, and make an announcement to all participants that need to claim their grant.\n2. Highlight sources of information that might benefit participants from knowing about. These may include: OceanDAO news, upcoming features, products and services that connect to this moment (Seed, Pearl, Wiki, How-Tos, Videos).\n\n### DoD: Comms\n- [ ] Write a blog post summarizing Funding Round Results, Winners, and interesting information that participants may benefit from being informed of.\n- [ ] Improve the following templated e-mail and send it to all participants of R{{ROUND_NUMBER}}.  \n- [ ] Improve the following templated Discord message and share it in Discord => #ocean-dao. \n\n---\n\n> SUBJECT: OceanDAO Round {{ROUND_NUMBER}} - Next Steps\n>\n> Hello OceanDAO contributor,\n> \n> thank you for participating in OceanDAO Round {{ROUND_NUMBER}}!\n> \n> If you did not receive a grant this round, we highly encourage you to keep on building, and apply for another grant in the next round.\n>\n> If you did win a grant, congratulations!\n>\n> Regardless of your outcome, this email will help you with taking next steps to continue progressing inside OceanDAO.\n> \n> CLAIMING YOUR GRANT:  \n> If you won any funding, do not forget to claim your grant.

After this date, we may collect the funds or take other actions that may keep you from accessing your funds.\n> \n> KEEP GROWING:  \n> Below are various recommendations to continue improving your chances to receive funding in OceanDAO.\n> 1. Join our Discord Channel (updates, clarify questions, join working groups, sync with ecosystem projects and Ocean core team members)  \n> 2. Come say hi in our project guiding channel in our Discord (Find support, connections, feedback on your project, etc.)  \n> 3. Attend Town Halls (learn about the latest developments in OceanDAO, grantee updates, deep shares,..)  \n> 4. Get vocal: (Share your updates in our Discord amplify channel, request to do a grantee update during Town Hall in ocean-dao channel, request a deep share,..)  \n>\n> Thank you for contributing to OceanDAO!\n\n---\n\n> [Round 16 - Voting Period Ended - 12 Projects Funded]\nThe voting period has now completed, and winners have been calculated,\nThank you all who submitted a proposal for R16! \uD83D\uDE80\n> \n> Congratulations to all the projects that have received funding this round. \uD83D\uDC69\u200D\uD83D\uDCBB\uD83D\uDC68\u200D\uD83D\uDCBB\n> \n> If you did not receive funding this round, please come back again in Round 17.\nWe have BIG improvements, and next round, everyone will win something (Quadratic Funding). \uD83D\uDCAA\n> \n> [212k OCEAN - Funding Results] You can find more details on the results here: \uD83D\uDCDC\nIn our R16 Notion Page => https://oceandao.notion.site/Round-16-Votes-d7aa2f3678d34dcda87b878bce228ff8\n> \n> [UPDATE: One team withdrew, and more funding was made available]\nAlgovera: Is now fully funded.\nClean Docs: Has now received partial funding.\n> \n> 4 Questions/Things you might be asking: \uD83E\uDD14\n> \n> Pearl is not 100% sync'd with us, so partial funded projects are off.

Projects who were already receiving partial funding, are now receiving a bit more. ❤️\n> We had also adjusted the earmarks to grow relative to what they were already configured to. This enabled us to redistribute the amount above. \uD83E\uDDEE\n> We are not applying the \"Min USD Requested\" rule this round (teams impacted were unaware of what this meant).
